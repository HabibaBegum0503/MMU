Responsive design:

To make my webpages more responsive I used the meta tag viewport on all my html files so that the size of the webpage 
is the same size as the screen being used to view the website. I used viewport height and width in my css files when 
sizing the objects so that they respond and change size to fit the viewport. For example I used 40vh which would change 
the height of the object so it is 40% of the viewport height.
